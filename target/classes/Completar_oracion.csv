"<p>Acid/Base Science Experiment Cabbage Indicator You will need: -a jar of pickled red cabbage from the grocery -vinegar -baking soda -a drinking glass Traditionally, to do this experiment, you need a fresh, red cabbage. You grate up the cabbage and then use one of several methods to extract the juice from it. Instead, we will just open the jar of pickled red cabbage and drain the juice from that into a glass. You can save the cabbage to have with your supper. Be sure to at least try a taste, as many people like it. I know I do.<span class="remover">Pour</span> some of the juice into a saucer. Now comes the fun part.</p>"|1|7-BYKKtXCGU
"<p><span class="remover">Sprinkle</span> just a tiny pinch of baking soda into the juice. <span class="remover">Watch</span> what happens. As soon as the white baking soda hits the red cabbage juice, you get green foam. If you put in much baking soda, you will get a lot of green foam, so be ready to clean up your mess. Eventually, all of your red cabbage juice will turn green. It seems that our experiment is over, but it is not. Now it is time to get out the vinegar.</p>"|2|7-BYKKtXCGU
"<p><span class="remover">Add</span> a little vinegar to the green cabbage juice. What do you get? Pink foam! Again, there is the potential for lots of mess, so either be careful or have lots of paper towels ready.</p>"|3|7-BYKKtXCGU
<p>Once your cabbage juice is red again, guess what comes next. More baking soda and more green foam. You can keep going back and forth, over and over. Why?</p>|4|7-BYKKtXCGU
